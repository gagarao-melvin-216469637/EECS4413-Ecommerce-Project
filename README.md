<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal is to produce an e-commerce website that meets the frontend and backend expectations of a product specification document.

A convenience company wants to create an online store. You must design, implement, test and deploy a
web application that supports Customers and Administrators to interact with the e-store.

Registered Customers can execute several use cases, including
* List catalogue items
* Filter catalog items by type
* Filter catalog items by brand
* View details of a product
* Add items to shopping cart
* Edit or remove items from the shopping cart
* “Check out” by providing credit card information and shipping information to purchase the items in the shopping cart
* Write reviews on items
* Register
* Sign in
* Sign out

Administrators: are the owners of the store; they have access to the following use case
* Run Reports on sells
* Run reports on application usage

You will develop a multi-tier web application, with clear separation between front and back-end. It is
expected you add an original use case to the above list.
